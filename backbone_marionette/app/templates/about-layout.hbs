            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p> I am fully qualified and chartered engineer who is working as a Web Application developer and UX specialist. I have keen interest in developing rich internet applciations using HTML, CSS and Javascript. My goal is to produce applications that look awesome but also have an intuitive user experience and are fully accessible to all users.
            </p>

            <p> Outside of my day job my main interests include football, fitness, motorcycles and music. Football is my main passion in which I operate primarily as a winger / wing back. I really enjoy keeping fit and am currently trying to master calisthenics. I also love music and play electric guitar.
