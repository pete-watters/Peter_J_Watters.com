TODO
======================================

- for the blog part could use either marionette-blog as a template or else the angular portfolio site i had been doing

Priority list should be:
1) Update LinkedIn to be more concise

2) Make portfolio live with static content

3) Connect LinkedIn profile to portfolio page

4) Populate portfolio sample arrays to show work done - first with sites I'd already done

5) Connect Tumblr to my own blog front end in either Ember like D's or else Angular using Lynda.com angular template
