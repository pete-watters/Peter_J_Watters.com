TODO

- add form validation to contact
- do something with latest tweets
    - does it stay tweets / become news from Tumblr? -> Should be latest posts and then read more on my blog page
    - need a model for it anyway

- do I want to have a download resume? if so it should not have my phone number
    - best to remove it / get it to say please contact me and jump to the form
    - could be best to just totally remove it then

- should I bother using couch?
- figure out where to put models

===============================

 - power most of the profile information using the linkedIn API(obviously take a backup though as a fallback - once it works once store it as a model and use that if cannot connect)
    - once source of truth for my info
    - another sample of pulling data from a restful API
