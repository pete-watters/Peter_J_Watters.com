TODO

- add form validation to contact
- do something with latest tweets
    - does it stay tweets / become news from Tumblr? -> Should be latest posts and then read more on my blog page
    - need a model for it anyway

- do I want to have a download resume? if so it should not have my phone number
    - best to remove it / get it to say please contact me and jump to the form
    - could be best to just totally remove it then

- should I bother using couch?
- figure out where to put models

===============================

 - power most of the profile information using the linkedIn API(obviously take a backup though as a fallback - once it works once store it as a model and use that if cannot connect)
    - once source of truth for my info
    - another sample of pulling data from a restful API


======================================


- for the blog part could use either marionette-blog as a template or else the angular portfolio site i had been doing

Priority list should be:
1) Update LinkedIn to be more concise
2) Make portfolio live with static content
3) Connect LinkedIn profile to portfolio page
4) Populate portfolio sample arrays to show work done - first with sites I'd already done
5) Connect Tumblr to my own blog front end in either Ember like D's or else Angular using Lynda.com angular template
6)

======================

Palestine bucket:
- no water, cannot freeze it, rubble bucket
- Israel takes over 80% of the water each year: http://visualizingpalestine.org/infographic/wb-water

- ALS is a worthy cause for concern but there are other things happening we cannot continue to ignore
- 5,600 people diagnosed with it in the US per year

In 2014 Palestine death toll is 1,400 - up to 80% of who were civilians
-
- ALS it is an awful disease we need to help fix however currently we are experiencing a genocide in Palestine

- Personally I feel the ALS challenge its a way to do something stupid to avoid donating to charity
- I will do it but also donate to Palestine adn use this chance to share my voice
- Perhaps I can spread the word again about Palestine and encourage you to connect with Ehab to donate

-> Maybe I should just get Tara to throw stones over my head and link to the Palestine rubble challenge
-=> nominate everyone to NOT do the challenge but to send money to Palestine
